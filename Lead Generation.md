# **Lead Generation**

Proper lead generation and vendor ranking are essential so the sales team can quickly prioritize, sign, and pair the best vendor.

﻿

## **Identify the location and sales parameters.**

1. You will first receive a call to action in Slack under the "lead generation" tab that reads "New vendor lead list requested in Hubspot for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \!". You can find the school's address within the HubSpot link.  
2. Your vendor sales rep will then identify the sales parameter. Some examples being:  
   1. "Please search for a Catering Company within a 15-mile range." Here are some examples of good leads:  
      * ﻿[https://canyoncatering.net/](https://canyoncatering.net/)﻿

      * ﻿[https://latin-asian-fusion.com/catering-and-events/](https://latin-asian-fusion.com/catering-and-events/) Here are some examples of bad leads:  
      * ﻿[https://cleaneatz.com/catering](https://cleaneatz.com/catering) (if a company is too large and has more than \~4 locations they not good to work with)  
      * ﻿[https://www.chipotle.com/](https://www.chipotle.com/)﻿  
      * ﻿[https://www.navarrostacosandcatering.com/catering](https://www.navarrostacosandcatering.com/catering) (stay away from vendors that are limited to cooking food groups such as Mexican or Asian cuisine )  
   2. "For this vendor, we are in need of nearby pizza shops and diners. Please stay away from catering companies here or large chain pizza shops/diners." Good lead: [https://larcobrospizza.com/.](https://larcobrospizza.com/) Bad lead: [https://www.dominos.com/en/](https://www.dominos.com/en/)﻿  
3. Open your Excel doc with the [correct information fields](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17dRZmUCYNpGP_ZBbLNbKhwpsIZXgLG_4ywOmAUqkDkQ/edit?usp=sharing) and begin the hunt\!

## **Lead Generation Methods**

**Google Maps locating**

1. Open Google Maps and insert the school's address. [Example.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Northwood+Academy/@33.0628874,-80.1005353,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x88fe6177474a1683:0x3f90bc6baa81b875!8m2!3d33.0628874!4d-80.0979604!16s%2Fg%2F1tpbcv9n?entry=ttu)﻿  
2. On the top of the screen click the "Restaurants" button and then replace restaurants with "Catering" in the search bar.  
3. This will give you a list of catering companies listed by distance to the school.

**Google Dorking (Facebook/Instagram)**

1. Open the Google browser on your computer.  
2. Input this in the search bar:  
   1. For Facebook leads: SITE:FACEBOOK.com"cater""@gmail.com""**location**"  
   2. For Instagram leads: SITE:[INSTAGRAM.com](http://instagram.com/)”cater""@gmail.com""**location**"  
3. This will yield all the facebook and Instagram accounts that are in the desired location and have gmails attached.

**Local Media/Press**

1. Using local media outlets is a great way to locate respected catering companies. Try searching things like "Top 10 catering companies in Charleston, SC". Here are some results:  
   1. ﻿[https://www.weddingwire.com/c/sc-south-carolina/charleston-florence-myrtle-beach/wedding-caterers/570-3-rca.html](https://www.weddingwire.com/c/sc-south-carolina/charleston-florence-myrtle-beach/wedding-caterers/570-3-rca.html)﻿

   3. ﻿[https://top10weddingvendors.com/charleston/catering-charleston-sc/](https://top10weddingvendors.com/charleston/catering-charleston-sc/)﻿

**Social Media**

1. Some catering companies rely heavily on Social Media to obtain their clientele and might be overlooked if looking just at Google. Some examples:  
   1. ﻿[https://www.facebook.com/NewLeafCateringPalmSprings](https://www.facebook.com/NewLeafCateringPalmSprings)﻿  
   2. ﻿[https://www.facebook.com/CoburnsCatering](https://www.facebook.com/CoburnsCatering)﻿  
   3. ﻿[https://www.instagram.com/ingoodcompanynash/](https://www.instagram.com/ingoodcompanynash/)﻿

**Beyond "Catering Companies"**

1. Expanding your search to businesses that are branded as things such as meal prep or meal delivery may yield companies that fit within what we are looking for.
